-BASE- To convert your string, or integer to binary, just add text into the text function.


-BASE- Then, add your encoding prefrence, options include, sha-1, sha-256, md5, sha224, sha384, sha518, utf-16 ##if you wonder why there is no utf-8, if has to be encoded to be converted to a hash, so i choose utf-8.


-BASE- If this is not working, add an issue on my Github Repository: github.com/BorneNeedsHelp/text2binhash


-text- Text to convert! Needs to be a string.


-encoding- Encoding to apply to the text, needs to one of the options above.
